//this is how you do middleware asynchronous operations using redux-toolkit
//fetchAddress becomes an aciton creator function that can be used in dispatch function.

//1.create a function using creaeteAsyncThunk, by passing action name and the async function with your actual logic.
//2.this automatically creates an aciton creator function with same name as function name. The the value being returned from the async function will be used as payload.
//3.we can access this payload in the reducer function under extraReducers proprty.
